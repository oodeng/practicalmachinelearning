## Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup

As suggested by Coursera instruction, this index.html is hosted by gh-pages. So graders should be easier to evaluate my report in HTML format. The HTML page can be viewed online <a target="_blank" href="http://easternmie.github.io">http://easternmie.github.io</a>

For graders information, my assignment_prediction.html is renamed to index.html to be easier.
